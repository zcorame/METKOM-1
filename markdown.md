#  What I learned? ðŸ«£ #

I learn about how to clone, how to use commit and push, to use markdown, styling text, create profile README.

After I learned, I knew the function of `clone`, which is to copy the entire project from GitHub to the computer, so it can be done locally.

Then I learned to `commit` I learned how to save new notes or make changes in those notes and don't forget to `push` so that the change notes can be sent to GitHub to be saved and can be seen by others.

After that, `markdown` is usually used in readme files or documents to write neat and structured text.

Then, I made a `profile README` for the front page of the github profile, a place to write about biodata, skills, and projects that are displayed.

Then the last one, I learned `text styling` so you can edit text so *italicized*, **bold**, ~~crossed out~~ and others.
